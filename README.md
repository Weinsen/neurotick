# Neurotick

Small project of Neural Networks for education reasons. The main goal is to achieve an easy to use, easy to train Neural Network and then "compile" a static and performatic model, for either run as a stand-alone or to be included in another project.

## Build

cd ./Build
cmake ..
make

## To Do

- Copy model ***
- Input values (reference)
- Train method
- Save model to file
- Templates
- Transfer functions
- "Compile" into static and more performatic model
